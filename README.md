# Integrated-Circuit-Technology

This is the Project for Course Integrated Circuit Technology.

Project Name : Fabrication of CMOS using N-Well Process
Repository Contains the Presentation with Necessary Masks needed for the process and detailed steps in a excel sheet.

Project Explains clearly from Step 1 - Picking a suitable wafer to successfully fabricating a CMOS device.

It walks you through steps like oxidation, Mask patterning, Etching and Metalization etc.

Excel sheet contains exact and precise values of temperature to be maintained at everystep, constant and limited source diffusion values etc. for the whole process.
